## Demo Jupyter Notebooks: ##

**1. Project Administration and Lifecycle.ipynb**
(SQL Notebook)

Provides an overview of how to create, deploy, connect/query, and shut down an AI Unlimited project


**2.  Simple Use Case: Vector Embeddings and KMeans clustering**

(Python Notebooks)

A demo that shows how to usr AI Unlimited to perform vector embeddings against a retail customer comments data set using an open-source language model; and use the output of the embedding to develop a customer segmentation model.

Uses two notebooks:

- 0_Load_Vector_Demo_Data.ipynb will perform a set of one-time operations to create foreign tables and views for the demo

- Kmeans_Segmentation_Using_Vector_Embeddings.ipynb is the demo notebook
