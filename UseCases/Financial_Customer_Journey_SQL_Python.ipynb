    "<p style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial;color:#00233C'>Teradata has unique analytic capabilities for understanding customer and user behavior over time.  These analytic techniques can be applied at massive scale to derive more accurate results. Then, these results can be combined with other analytics to create more advanced and accurate prediction models.  The scalable, massively-parallel architecture of the platform also allows organizations to scale these models horizontally, by training segmented models per region, user type, etc., or vertically, by combining data from millions or billions of interactions. All of this can be deployed operationally to understand and predict actions in real-time.</p>\n",
